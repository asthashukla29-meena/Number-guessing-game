# Number-guessing-game
This Number- guessing game is a beginner-friendly interactive project developed as a part of my early journey into programming and problem solving.
## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to enhance logical thinking and problem-solving skills by implementing core programming constructs in a real-world
scenario.
## Features
- Generates a random number within a specified range.
- accepts user input for guessing the number.
- provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low.
- continues until the correct number is guessed.
## Technology used
  - c programming language.
## Learning outcome
  through this project,i gained a deeper understanding of:
  - control structures(if-else statements).
  - looping constructs.
  - random number generation.
  - user input and output handling.

This project represents one of my initial steps towards building practical programming skills and developing interactive applications.
